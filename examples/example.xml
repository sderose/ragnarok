<title>Part one – The Gestabáttr</title>

<stanza n="1">
With all doorways,
before walking through,
you must look around,
you must peer around,
one can not know,
where enemies
are sitting inside.
</stanza>

<stanza n="2">
Hail to the host!
A guest has arrived,
where is he to sit?
Anxiously he,
hopes to find,
a place by the fire.
</stanza>

<stanza n="3">
Fire is needed,
for the one who has come
with his knees cold;
food and clothes,
the man need
who have traveled over mountains.
</stanza>

<stanza n="4">
Water is needed,
for the one who is to eat,
a towel and great hospitality,
met with good manners,
and if he can have it,
conversation and quiet.
</stanza>
